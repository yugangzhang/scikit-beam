Grid-building functions
-----------------------

:func:`pixels_to_radius` and :func:`pixels_to_phi` were renamed to
:func:`radial_grid` and :func:`angle_grid` respectively. The name and order
of their arguments was also changed: see their docstring or API docs for
details. Importantly, the orientation of the output of angle grid has been
changed. Again, see the docstring for details.
