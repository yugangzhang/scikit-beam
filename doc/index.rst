scikit-beam: Data Analysis Tools for X-ray Science
==================================================

scikit-beam is a Python package providing tools for X-ray science.
For a brief introduction to the ideas behind the package, you can read the
:ref:`introductory notes <introduction>`.

Users who prefer drag-and-drop software may prefer to use
`vistrails <http://www.vistrails.org/index.php/Main_Page>`__, through which
all the functionality of scikit-beam is also available.
(Think LabView for X-ray image processing and data analysis.)


The :ref:`tutorial <tutorial>` walks through several experiments from start to
finish -- from the raw data to a publication-style plot. You can also browse
the :ref:`API reference <api_ref>` for a quick overview of all the available
tools.
