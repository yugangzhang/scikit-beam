    ----------
    x1, x2 : array-like
        Input arrays. `x1` and `x2` must be of the same shape.

    output : array-like
        Boolean result with the same shape as `x1` and `x2` of the logical

    -------
    output : {ndarray, bool}
        Boolean result with the same shape as `x1` and `x2` of the logical

    Returns
    -------

    This function enables LOGICAL SUBTRACTION of one binary image or volume

    without having to worry about mislabeling of pixels which would result
    from arithmetic subtraction. This function will evaluate as true for all
    "true" voxels present ONLY in Source Dataset 1. This function can be used

    ----------
